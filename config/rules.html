<b><h1>N.T.C Hallowstone Server Rules and Guidelines</b></h1>

<h3>Note From Managment</h3>
Rules can be changed at any time by hosts. HOWEVER, you CANNOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE for a rule that is NOT WRITTEN HERE.
If we realize you did something that a rule should cover it, we will ask you to not do it again and add to the rules list.

<h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
Treat others the way that you wish to be treated. We are all here for a good time, so if you feel like youre being a dick, thats not a good thing.
While showing some hostility or toxicity will not get you banned immediately, continued hostility or toxicity could result in a ban from our server.
Just be nice guys, I mean come on its a 2D spaceman game.

<h3>Rule 0</h3>
This is a pretty simple rule to ask you to abide by. Normally, if an admin PMs you, it means we have noticed less than stellar RP and are wanting to know the reasoning behind it.
It could also mean weve received complaints about your RP and are wanting your side of the story. Admins do not get paid to do their job, so be respectful. Answer the PM. Do not let it sit there.
<br><br>
<b>That Being Said</b>
<br>
If you feel an admin is being hostile to /you/, ask for a different admin and file an inquiry.

<h3>Rule 1</h3>
This is an Heavy RolePlay server, so make an effort to RP accordingly. Attempt to make the round interesting for everyone. Do not self-antag (Please see the guidelines on what an antag is). Respect other players RP and character development.

<h3>Rule 2</h3>
No racism, sexism, or hate talk. Its not allowed here and we are sure players do not appreciate seeing it in game. There is no exception to this rule.

<h3>Rule 3</h3>
<b>THERE IS NO ERP ALLOWED AT ALL. IF YOU PERFORM EROTIC ROLE PLAY YOU WILL RECEIVE A BAN.</b>
<h4>Rule 3-A</h4>
<b>THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS. NONE.</b>

<h3>Rule 4</h3>
Play within your character. Do not find out something about someones character OOCly and then attempt to use it ICly unless the person it is about agrees that your character would know this information.
Do not play your character with knowledge they shouldnt have. This includes talking with your buddy on Skype or TeamSpeak and telling them what is going on around you.
<h4>Powergaming</h4>
Your character shouldnt be rushing into a FULL XENO NEST SCREAMING JOHHHNNN CEEENNAAA! with a flamethrower as a janitor. This is clearly not a logical concept for crew, as a Janitor would not know how to create a flamethrower. HOWEVER: An engineer having a basic knowledge of first aid is allowed. I.E. An engineer would be able to understand that an anti-toxin pill would remove toxins from their body.

<h3>Rule 5</h3>
Excessive toxic behavior is unacceptable and may result in a cool-off ban. Multiple accounts of toxic behavior may result in a ban. This rule applies  to everyone, if you feel a staff member is behaving in a toxin manner, please report it.

<h3>Rule 6</h3>
Use a proper name. The ID you get should have only your name, first and last. Dr. is allowed /if your character is actually a doctor/. Do not put middle names. DO NOT MAKE REFERENCES IN NAMES.

<h3>Rule 7</h3>
There is rarely a need to kill. Dont go killing because someone looked at you wrong, or if they accidentally disarmed you. Work it out, call security, do something other than kill if you can avoid it. It is grief, and is bannable. There needs to be extensive RP behind it, or clearance from the player ( Unless youre a traitor and its your objective. ) and telling the admins first. If we say no, then dont do it.

<h3>Rule 8</h3>
Multikeying is using a second (or third or fourth…) ckey to evade a ban or play two characters at once. Its bad. Dont do it. Its fine to have friends and such on but doing to play multiple characters or avoid a ban will either get you banned, or if to avoid a ban, will get you perma-banned.

<h3>Rule 9</h3>
This is an English speaking server. Accents and a few scattered alter-lingos are fine, but we expect to understand you. (This, obviously, does not apply to alien languages)

<h3>Rule 10</h3>
Shuttle Grief or End of Round Grief is not allowed: Just… do not do it. The round does not end until the next round begins.

<h3>Rule 11</h3>
Do not post real information about a player in OOC, IC, DSAY or LOOC. This is an /immediate/ permaban.

<h3>Rule 12</h3>
The following actions are immediate permabans. (Note that if the action is done by accident, or is pre-approved, the perma-ban is not applicable):
Engine Grief: Do not crit the engine on purpose. The SM, unlike the Singulo, is a bit harder to grief with, but its still a hassle to deal with when you come on and deliberately cause it to go critical.
Atmospheric Grief: Do not mess with the atmospherics of an area on purpose without proper RP. Proper Atmos Antagging MUST be approved.
Research/Toxins/Science grief: Do not take bombs outside of the designated areas without prior consent of an admin or Mentor.
Armoury Grief: No raiding the Armoury and going on a Rambo killing spree.
Dont gib people in the gibber.
Any other action that isnt listed above, but is still antagonistic will break the No Antagging if not an Antag rule.


<h2>Antag Guidelines</h2>
<b>Jim Killed the Rep</b>
<br><br>
<b>As An Antagonist</b><br>
You should try to the best of your abilities to make the round fun and interesting.<br>
Failing to follow these guidelines may result in an Antag Ban.

<h3>Guideline 1</h3>
Antagonists are <b>NOT</b> exempt from the rules unless otherwise stated. Yes you have to follow them.

<h3>Guideline 2</h3>
/Fights in game/ are not considered antagonistic as long as the fight has a reason to occur. Did he insult your mom? Deck him. Did he tell you to jump out an airlock? Give him a shiner! But dont take it too far.  Youre not killing a guy for pushing you out of a stool.Make the fight believable , you can scrap over an insult, but you dont need to stab someone in the eye for taking your candy bar.
<br><br>
Antags are NOT EXEMPT FROM SERVER RULES. Abide by them.
<br><br>
Antags are here for round enjoyment. Make sure that youre contributing to the RP, and that you are making others enjoy what is going on. Do your objectives, but also remember to blend in with the crowd. Youre not a murder boning Rambo. Stop that.
<br><br>
Players that are /caught/ as a traitor will not be able to take a head position for a week.
<br><br>
Gank From the Jungle: yeah…. This is a no. Dont blow up the bar for that /one officer you have to kill/ and wind up killing half the crew. Wait till that guy heads off to the bathroom after one too many beers, then strike.
<br><br>
Characters ARE ALLOWED TO CANON THEIR KNOWLEDGE ON WHAT CERTAIN ANTAGS ARE. That character will NEVER know everything there is to know about an antag. For example: Youll know theres a person out there that eats people and wears their clothes to get around the station. You will NEVER know it is a changling that stings people. However, they need to have seen the antag /on Babylon/ unless an admin approves. The colony /knows/ about the dangers of space, and they teach their young to be vigilant at all times. Knowledge is power, and theres safety in numbers. Did you /see/ a changeling eat someone? You remember it.. and change your pants. Did you see that cultist screaming some weird crap? Tell the Chaplain!
However, this doesnt mean you get to play hero or Rambo. Again, dont metagame, and dont powergame. It can seriously ruin RP for everyone, and turn an exciting event into something dull.

<h3>Guideline 5</h3>
Antags do not have to stick to their objectives. If you feel like kidnapping Ian, then go for it! Make these fun for everyone objective, heck maybe even get that bald assistant involved.
Just remember that you may only kill your objective, or in an act of self defense.

<h2>General Guidelines</h2>
<b>As A Player</b><br><br>
Have fun, is only a game why you heff to be mad ;) ?

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
It is a game. Do not take it too serious, and do not get upset at admins when we dont do what you want.
<br><br>
If you are griefed, adminhelp it. If we do not know about it, we cant do anything about it. If you see someone else being griefed, ahelp it. You could be next.
<br><br>
No IC in OOC or vice versa. It ruins player RP and just is frowned upon. Do not talk about OOC in IC chat. Do not bring up IC actions in OOC.
<br><br>
Role play pain upon receiving and injury. If you are shot in the chest, you should RP the pain of being shot in the chest. The only exception to RPing pain is if your character has nerve damage in the area they are shot in, or if youre Diona. And yes, we check vari medical records to see if thats true.
<br><br>
Wanting to antag, or do something that can be antagonistic. Antags are NOT allowed on the apartment server.
<br><br>
Unless an admin says it: All rounds are canon.
<br><br>
Try and not be passive aggressive to other players.
<br><br>
Dont complain if you break a Space Law and get arrested ICly for it.
<br><br>
We understand that your character has their own circles and friends, but try to interact with all of the crew. You should try and be open to RP from all types of players. We know its hard to force a rule about cliques, however, we can /ask/ you to be open, friendly and fluid in your RolePlay.
<br><br>

<h2>Character Guidelines</h2>
Characters should be beliavble and not chucklefucky. This means you can not have a 12ft Amazon woman named Bertha who owns half of NanoTrasen and who is related to Space Christ.
<br><br>
Flavor Texts are encouraged, but understand Flavor Texts are ONLY for /what your character can see with the visible eye/.
<br><br>
Do not make characters that are direct references to anything. No Osama, no Obama, no Yo Momma, no Darth Vader.
<br><br>
Maintain character at time. Do not slip out of character.
<br><br>
Restrict yourself to what your character knows. We are not saying your Janitor can not do surgery… but we expect his employment record to show he can do surgery.
<br><br>
Remember that your character has comfort needs. Feed them and dont leave them in hardsuits. They rust, and start to smell. Ew.
